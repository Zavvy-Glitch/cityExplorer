## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->This application was created in part to practice API calls. At the current the objective is to request information from various API's and wittle down the array to display specific portions within. Painpoints are listed below as follows:

As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see the exact latitude and longitude of that location.

As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.
Weather (live): As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.

As a user of City Explorer, I want to see info about movies related to the city I searched, so that I can learn more about the destination.

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

08-23-2021 15:36 - Application has form query functionality pulling information from LocationIQ API by using GET route.

08-24-2021 17:45 - Application now has functionality in pulling information from MOVIE API / WEATHER API. All CSS and stylings have been reset at this time. More items being rendered caused a bit of confusion when targetting specific objects to give attributes. Will require additions of classes and id's to various components. Items with react-bootstrap designs have been left as is.
